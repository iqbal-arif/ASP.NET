**Model Binding**
***

In ASP.NET Core, model binding is a feature that
simplifies capturing and storing data in a web app.

The process of model binding includes,

1. retrieving data from various sources,
1. converting them to collections of .NET types,
1. passing them to controllers/page models.
1. Helpers and attributes are used to render HTML with the contents of bound page models. And
1. Client- and server-side validation scripts are used to ensure integrity during data entry.
