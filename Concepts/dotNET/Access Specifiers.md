Every keyword that we use such as private, public, protected, virtual, sealed, partial, abstract, static, base, etc. is called Modifiers. Access Specifiers are special kinds of modifiers using which we can define the scope of a type and its members.

So, in simple words, we can say that the Access Specifiers are used to define
1. the scope of the type (Class, Interface, Structs, Delegate, Enum, etc.) as well as 
1. the scope of their members (Variables, Properties, Constructors, and Methods). 

***Scope** means accessibility or visibility that is who can access them and who cannot access them are defined by the Access Specifiers.

See, I have a class with a set of members, who can consume these members, and who cannot consume these members are defined by the access specifiers.
