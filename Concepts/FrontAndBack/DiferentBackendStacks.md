**Different Back-end Stacks**
***

Unlike the front-end, which must be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there’s a lot of flexibility in which technologies can be used in order to create the back-end of a web application. Developers can construct back-ends in many different languages like PHP, Java, JavaScript, Python, and more.

You don’t need to reinvent the wheel to create a robust back-end. Instead, most developers make use of frameworks which are collections of tools that shape the organization of your back-end and provide efficient ways of accomplishing otherwise difficult tasks.

There are numerous back-end frameworks from which developers can choose. Here are a few examples:
Framework--------Language
Laravel------------PHP
Express.js---------JavaScript (runs in the Node environment)
Ruby on Rails----Ruby
Spring------------Java
JSF---------------Java
Flask-------------Python
Django----------Python
ASP.NET---------C#

The collection of technologies used to create the front-end and back-end of a web application is referred to as a stack. This is where the term full-stack developer comes from; rather than working in either the front-end or the back-end exclusively, a full-stack developer works in both.

For example, the MEAN stack is a technology stack for building web applications that uses MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js: MongoDB is used as the database, Node.js with Express.js for the rest of the back-end, and Angular is used as a front-end framework. While the LAMP Stack, sometimes considered the archetypal stack, uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

**Review**

In order to deliver the front-end of a website or web application to a user, a lot needs to happen behind the scenes on the back-end! Understanding what makes up the back-end can be overwhelming because the back-end has a lot of different parts, and different websites or web applications can have dramatically different back-ends. We covered a lot in this lesson, so let’s review what we learned:

   1. The front-end of a website or application consists of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and static assets sent to a client, like a web browser.
  2. A web server is a process running on a computer somewhere that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.
  3. Storing, accessing, and manipulating data is a large part of a web application’s back-end
  4.  Data is stored in databases which can be relational databases or NoSQL databases.
  5.  The server-side of a web application, sometimes called the application server, handles important tasks such as authorization and authentication.
  6.  The back-end of web application often has a web API which is a way of interacting with an application’s data through HTTP requests and responses.
  7.  Together the technologies used to build the front-end and back-end of a web application are known as the stack, and many different languages and frameworks can be used to build a robust back-end.
