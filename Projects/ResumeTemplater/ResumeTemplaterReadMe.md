You’re currently in the early stages of building an application to showcase your resume online and certain pages need to be filled out; both view pages and page models. Using your knowledge of Razor Syntax you’ll be able to populate certain pages with your personal information.

   1. The Index page will contain data regarding your experience, and technical skills about what programming languages you know.
   2. The Projects page will contain information about the projects you have built!
